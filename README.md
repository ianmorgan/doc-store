# doc-store

Provides a simple document style persistence API with the 
following features: 

* data is stored using an event sourcing model in an 'event-store'.
* GraphQL API is provided for querying 
* Schema information can be attached to drive GraphQL 
API and to provide some level of validation when saving data.
* ike most document style stores, the ability to store both complete 
documents and partial updates is supported. 
* by keeping to simple, generic events this is deliberately aimed at problem 
domains where an aggregate can simply be modelled as a document. The architectural benefits of event sourcing are 
retained, for example another system could observe the events, but there is attempt to define state as a set of 
explicit domain events (AccountCreated, AccountApproved etc).
