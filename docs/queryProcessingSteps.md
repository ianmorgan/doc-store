# Query Processing Steps

To process a query, the [Data Access(DAO)](daos) and [(GraphQL)Fetchers](fetchers) are needed. 
 
The query: 

```
{droid(id: "2001"){name,starships{name,model},friends{name,friends(first: 2){name}}}}
``` 

Will be processed as follows: 

A [DocDataFetcher](https://github.com/ianmorgan/graph-store/blob/master/src/main/java/ianmorgan/graphstore/graphql/DocDataFetcher.kt)
for Droid will have been wired automatically by convention based on the 
return type of Droid in the GraphQL schema. When processing the query, GraphQL Java will call the
standard <code>get()</code> method which is passed the GraphQL Java 
'DataFetchingEnvironment' object. This has enough information to understand that this is a simple 
lookup by ID. 

GraphQL will also provide the following map of query args, which is basically the query converted to 
a Map. It has all the information apart from the entry to the query, <code>'droid(id: "2001")'</code>  

```json
{
  "name": {},
  "starships": {},
  "starships/name": {},
  "starships/model": {},
  "friends": {},
  "friends/name": {},
  "friends/friends": {"first": 2},
  "friends/friends/name": {}
}
```

The initial query for the Droid will just return the raw data. In JSON form (and with the fields not in the query 
excluded) this looks like:

```json
{
    "name" : "R2-D2",
    "starships" : [ "12" ],
    "friends" : [ "1000", "1002", "1003" ]
}
```

At this point we now need to expand out the ID fields by making further calls to the DAOs. There is a difference 
to the original call, which was passed the 'DataFetchingEnvironment' object as now the rules are driven by the map of 
query args instead. The steps in summary are: 

* find the docs we need to expand out by looking for the unique nodes in the args, in this case 'starships' and 'friends'
* for each of these rebuild a simpler set of args that represent the doc in question
* retrieve data and merge into the original map, replacing the IDs with real data
* recurse as necessary, e.g. finding friends of friends .

The [ArgsWalker](https://github.com/ianmorgan/graph-store/blob/master/src/main/java/ianmorgan/graphstore/graphql/ArgsWalker.kt)
encapsulates the rules necessary to 'walk' though the args - its really quite similar to walking a directory tree.

To retrieve data for the 'starships', using the ArgsWalker the node is rewritten as 
```json
{
  "name": {},
  "model": {}
}
```

And node() is <code>starships</code> (which is the information needed to call the correct fetcher)

And a call is made to the Starship DAO for each starship ID. After this, the data looks like 

```json
{
    "name" : "R2-D2",
    "starships" : [ {
            "name" : "X-wing",
            "model" : "T-65 X-wing"
          } ],
    "friends" : [ "1000", "1002", "1003" ]
}
```

The call for friends is a little more complex as this query has friends of friends. Using ArgsWalker,
the args are rewritten as 

```json
{
  "name": {},
  "friends": {"first": 2},
  "friends/name": {}
}
```

The first call just returns friends with the ID of their 
friends. So the data now looks like.

```json
{
  "name" : "R2-D2",
      "starships" : [ {
        "name" : "X-wing",
        "model" : "T-65 X-wing"
      } ],
      "friends" : [ {
        "name" : "Luke Skywalker",
        "friends" : "[1002, 1003, 2000, 2001]"
      }, {
        "name" : "Han Solo",
        "friends" : "[1001, 1003, 2001]"
      }, {
        "name" : "Leia Organa",
        "friends" : "[1000, 1002, 2000, 2001]"
      } ]
 }
```

To retrieve the friends of friends further calls are required. Using the ArgsWalker, the args below are built. Note 
that in this case a root node ("/") has been added as there are parameters to be passed into the query. 

```json
{
  "/": {"first": 2},
  "name": {}
}
```
