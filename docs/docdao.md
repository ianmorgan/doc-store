# Doc Dao

The basics of document storage are managed by a [DocDao](https://github.com/ianmorgan/doc-store/blob/master/src/main/java/ianmorgan/docstore/DocDao.kt)

The [DocsDao](https://github.com/ianmorgan/doc-store/blob/master/src/main/java/ianmorgan/docstore/DocsDao.kt) is 
simply a collection of all the docs with their Dao. Basically a DocDao is built for each type 
in the GraphQL schema. The rules for saving, retrieving and searching each DocDao is 
then driven from the GraphQL schema.

A schematic of the basic wiring implemented by the DocsDao is below.
